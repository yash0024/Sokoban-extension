A more difficult extension of the popular game Sokoban allowing various players on the grid. 

Allowed users to play the game and also designed various AI search algorithms to solve the puzzles. 

Designed various heuristics to implement algorithms like iterative greedy best-first search, A* search, weighted A* search, and iterative weighted A* search. Improved the heuristics leading to iterative weighted A* search solving about 95% of the example puzzles.
